# Analysis of AAYME Application Submissions
This repository contains simple EDA on the submissions to the AAYME Summer Camp. To execute the python script it's best to use a virtual environment. 

## Submission Timeline
The chart below shows the time series of the application submissions. It can easily be seen the spike noticed in April was largely due to the changes that were made to the application to limit the friction in applying.

# Where are the applications coming from?
When the camp was first idealised, it was desired to have a wide representation across the state. Because we got an extremely late start this year the committee was concerned if: 
* we would get enough submissions
* the submissions would be concentrated in central Mississippi (aka the Jackson, MS area). 
What you can see fromo the plot below we still managed to get a decent swath from across the state. Notibly we can see the delta regions have healthy representation.

# How do the candidates split out?
In addition to geospatial coverage we also aimed to have a balance across grade and income. The initial goal of AAYME was to provide an MSMS-like experience to African American students from low income families who might otherwise not have the opportunity. To that end, we wanted to ensure that when we selected camper this year that that vision is still realised. The charts below show the breakout across Income, and Grade Level.
